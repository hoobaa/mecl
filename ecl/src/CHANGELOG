ECL 12.12.1:
============

* Visible changes:

 - delete-file, rename-file, chdir, mkdir and chmod now signal file-errors

 - Upgraded ASDF and incorporated ASDF-BUNDLE instead of ASDF-ECL

 - SYS:FUNCTION-LAMBDA-LIST works again with macros and special operators

 - Link in ecl-help to avoid problems in standalone programs that need
   DOCUMENTATION

 - ECL now generates properly indented and more readable C code, with less
   labels and more standard constructs.

* Bugs fixed:

 - Improvements in the performance of the new multiprocessing library.

 - Fixes in the queue for POSIX signals, which caused repeated Ctrl-C to get
   lost.

 - Fixed typos that affected support for long long and unsigned long long.

 - The code in ecl_import_current_thread() did not follow the GC API.

 - The version of COMPILE-FILE in the bytecodes compiler did not support
   :EXTERNAL-FORMAT keyword

 - The compiled version of DOTIMES evaluated the output form in the wrong
   context

 - ecl_import_current_thread() did not bind *current-process*

 - Changed the algorithm for computing whether a function is a closure or not,
   and which type of C closure it needs.

 - '. returned SI:|.| while this is an internal way to construct lists

* Metaobject protocol:

 - ECL fully supports the MOP.

 - Completely changed ECL's class bootstrapping protocol, which is now simpler
   and more effective, .allowing us to have all classes from the very
   beginning.

 - All accessors are redefined as generic functions after bootstrapping ECL.

 - Standard class accessors are now optimized. This is possible because they
   rely on slot-value, which as per the MOP cannot be redefined or wrapped
   around without introducing new metaclasses.

 - ECL's compiler no longer inlines the accessors to metaobject slots, allowing
   for redefinition.

 - (SETF SLOT-VALUE) did not always return the assigned value

 - SLOT-BOUNDP returned extra values in error conditions

 - SLOT-VALUE-USING-CLASS did not invoke SLOT-UNBOUND
