		;;; the variable is referenced across Level Boundary and thus
		;;; cannot be allocated on the C stack.  Note that OBJECT is
		;;; set during variable binding and CLB is set when the
		;;; variable is used later, and therefore CLB may supersede
		;;; OBJECT.

  		;;; For :FIXNUM, :CHAR, :FLOAT, :DOUBLE, :OBJECT:
  		;;;   the cvar for the C variable that holds the value.
  		;;; For LEXICAL or CLOSURE: the frame-relative address for
		;;; the variable in the form of a cons '(lex-levl . lex-ndx)

;;; A function may be compiled into a CFUN, CCLOSURE or CCLOSURE+LISP_CLOSURE
;;; Here are examples of function FOO for the 3 cases:
;;; 1.  (flet ((foo () (bar))) (foo))		CFUN
;;; 2.  (flet ((foo () (bar))) #'foo)		CFUN+LISP_CFUN
;;; 3.  (flet ((foo () x)) #'(lambda () (foo))) CCLOSURE
;;; 4.  (flet ((foo () x)) #'foo)		CCLOSURE+LISP_CLOSURE

;;; A function can be referenced across a ccb without being a closure, e.g:
;;;   (flet ((foo () (bar))) #'(lambda () (foo)))
;;;   [the lambda also need not be a closure]
;;; and it can be a closure without being referenced across ccb, e.g.:
;;;   (flet ((foo () x)) #'foo)  [ is this a mistake in local-function-ref?]
;;; Here instead the lambda must be a closure, but no closure is needed for foo
;;;   (flet ((foo () x)) #'(lambda () (foo)))
;;; So we use two separate fields: ref-ccb and closure.
;;; A CCLOSURE must be created for a function when:
;;; 1. it appears within a FUNCTION construct and
;;; 2. it uses some ccb references (directly or indirectly).
;;; ref-ccb corresponds to the first condition, i.e. function is referenced
;;;   across CCB. It is computed during Pass 1. A value of 'RETURNED means
;;;   that it is immediately within FUNCTION.
;;; closure corresponds to second condition and is computed in Pass 2 by
;;;   looking at the info-referenced-vars and info-local-referenced of its body.

;;; A LISP_CFUN or LISP_CLOSURE must be created when the function is returned.
;;; The LISP funob may then be referenced locally or across LB or CB:
;;;     (flet ((foo (z) (bar z))) (list #'foo)))
;;;     (flet ((foo (z) z)) (flet ((bar () #'foo)) (bar)))
;;;     (flet ((foo (z) (bar z))) #'(lambda () #'foo)))
;;; therefore we need field funob.
