This module implements SSE intrinsic functions for ECL and SBCL.

NOTE: CURRENTLY THIS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED EXPERIMENTAL, AND
      SUBJECT TO INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES IN A FUTURE RELEASE.

Since the implementation is closely tied to the internals of
the compiler, it should normally be obtained exclusively via
the bundled contrib mechanism of the above implementations.
